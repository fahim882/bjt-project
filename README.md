Project 1: Transistor-Based Amplifier This circuit demonstrates a common-emitter amplifier using a BC548 transistor. The amplifier takes an AC input signal, amplifies it, and provides a higher voltage output. Key components include:

Resistors for biasing Coupling capacitors to block DC components A transistor for amplification The simulation results show how the circuit increases the amplitude of the input signal.

Project 2: Full-Wave Rectifier This circuit is a bridge rectifier built using four diodes (1N1183) and a resistor load. The goal of this circuit is to convert an AC input signal into a pulsating DC output.

The diodes are arranged in a bridge configuration to allow both halves of the AC cycle to be rectified. The simulation results confirm the expected rectified waveform.
